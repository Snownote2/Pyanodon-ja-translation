[recipe-description]
petroleum-gas2=Feed the knallgas bacteria colony directly with purified compressed hydrogen to cause bacterial blooms. The bacteria will produce petroleum gas as a byproduct.
split-yellowcake=Needs more frosting.
neutron-absorbston=Suck up all those extra neutrons.
mirror-mk01-poor=Attempt to cast a mirror without a crucible. High chance of failure.
purest-nitrogen-gas=Decompose environmental compounds according to small differences in their boiling points. Only a fraction of pure nitrogen can be recovered.
biocarnation-harvesting=Instruct your lumber bots to harvest the biocarnations.
biocrud-reprocessing=Reprocess the biocrud into useful biological materials.
rich-biocrud-reprocessing=Reprocess the rich biocrud into useful biological materials.
floraspollinin-reprocessing=Kill and prune selective areas of the floraspollinin growths to revert the flora to an earlier stage in the harvest cycle.
biocrud-pyrolysis=Pyrolyze the biocrud into useful hydrocarbon chains.
lrf-steam-1=Perform heat transfer between heated salt and water to produce high-pressurized steam.
lrf-steam-2=Perform heat transfer between heated salt and water to produce high-pressurized steam.
